        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">Pugs originated in China, around 400 B.C. at the earliest, but they're potentially older. 
            Pugs average lifespan is 11-15, with the oldest recorded pug, Snookie, dying in 2018 at the age of 27. 
            Pugs usually experience multiple health problems due to being bread to purposely have shorter snouts.
            Some of these problems include bad eyesight, or trouble breathing.
            Pugs are generally pretty chubby for their size, with their typical breed weight being 14-18 pounds but can be as heavy as 30 pounds before being classified as overweight!</p>
